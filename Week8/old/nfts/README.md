# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn add hardhat
npx hardhat init
yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install dotenv
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle @openzeppelin/contracts @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades



cd client
npm install
npm run dev

```
